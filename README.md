## 3. Machine Learning Courses

Pick one of those three courses:
* [Machine Learning Crash Course  |  Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
* [Kaggle Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
* [Machine Learning Course Andrew Ng| Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)

## 4. Practise!

Solve Challenges and build your own projects with datasets from [Kaggle.com](Kaggle.com).

## Books
If you prefer learning with books, these are great recommendations:

* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
* [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-pytorch-and-scikit-learn/9781801819312)

## What about math?
You don't have to worry too much about math until this point. But if you want to get a deeper understanding, you can check out these resources:

 * [Khan Academy - Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
 * [Khan Academy - Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)
